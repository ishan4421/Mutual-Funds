# Mutual-Funds
Mutual Funds are great investment options if we cannot spend time in stock picking. But in real-world, there are a lot of mutual funds. So i took a dataset from Kaggle that has around 1500 funds. 
I have found 26 funds that can give good returns. No investment recommendations. TAKE ALL DECISIONS AT OWN RISK. This is only my analysis. 
Favourable fund qualities- higher than 4 rating by Morningstar and Value Research. Not take decisions according to your risk appetites.

Morningstar and Value Research are two well-known financial research and investment analysis firms that provide independent ratings and insights on mutual funds, stocks, ETFs, and other financial products. Both help investors make informed decisions by offering objective ratings, detailed analysis, and performance data on various investment instruments. Here’s a breakdown of each:

1. Morningstar
Overview: Morningstar is a global financial services firm headquartered in the United States. It’s widely recognized for its mutual fund and stock research and analysis. The firm offers investment management services and has a reputation for its in-depth analysis and ratings.
Morningstar Rating: One of its most well-known tools is the Morningstar Rating (also called the "star rating"). This is a quantitative measure of a mutual fund’s historical performance relative to its risk. The rating is based on a fund’s past performance and risk-adjusted returns.
Ratings range from 1 to 5 stars:
5 stars: Top 10% of funds in a category.
4 stars: Next 22.5% of funds.
3 stars: Middle 35%.
2 stars: Next 22.5%.
1 star: Bottom 10%.
Criteria: Morningstar looks at past performance but adjusts it for risk, meaning funds with higher returns and lower risk tend to get better ratings. However, it’s important to note that the rating is backward-looking and doesn’t predict future performance.
2. Value Research
Overview: Value Research is an Indian firm specializing in mutual fund analysis, financial planning, and stock market research. It is a trusted name for investors in India seeking guidance on mutual funds and financial products. The firm provides detailed reports and analysis, especially for Indian mutual funds.
Value Research Rating: Similar to Morningstar, Value Research provides a 5-star rating system for mutual funds, but its rating system is specific to the Indian mutual fund industry.
The rating is based on a fund’s historical risk-adjusted performance relative to other funds in its category. It also looks at consistency in performance.
Ratings range from 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the best-performing funds in terms of risk-adjusted returns.
Additional Insights: Value Research provides extensive reports, historical data, and fund comparison tools to help investors select the best funds based on their goals and risk appetite.
Comparison of Morningstar and Value Research
Scope:
Morningstar is a global platform, covering international markets and various financial instruments like stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds worldwide.
Value Research is more focused on the Indian mutual fund market and provides region-specific analysis.
Rating Methodology:
Both use a 5-star rating system based on risk-adjusted returns.
However, their data inputs and methodology might vary, especially in terms of what they consider important in risk and return.
Focus:
Morningstar offers comprehensive tools and data, especially for U.S.-based investors or global investors looking at various asset classes.
Value Research focuses more on Indian mutual funds and retail investors in India.
How Investors Use These Ratings
Comparing Funds: Investors often compare mutual funds based on their Morningstar and Value Research ratings to identify top performers in their respective categories.
Risk vs. Return: Since both platforms incorporate risk-adjusted returns into their ratings, these ratings help investors choose funds that offer the best performance relative to the level of risk.
Decision Making: While these ratings can help narrow down investment options, it’s essential to use them alongside other factors like fund objectives, fees, fund manager expertise, and personal investment goals.
