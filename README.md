# Mutual-Funds
Mutual Funds are great investment options if we cannot spend time in stock picking. But in real-world, there are a lot of mutual funds. So i took a dataset from Kaggle that has around 1500 funds. 
I have found 26 funds that can give good returns. No investment recommendations. TAKE ALL DECISIONS AT OWN RISK. This is only my analysis. 
Favourable fund qualities- higher than 4 rating by Morningstar and Value Research. Not take decisions according to your risk appetites. 

The dataset contains following columns:
